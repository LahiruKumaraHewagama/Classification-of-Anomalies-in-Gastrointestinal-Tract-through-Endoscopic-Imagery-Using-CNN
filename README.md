In this challenge, you will learn how machine learning can be applied to medical imaging.
You will use the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract endoscopic imagery in order to detect different anomaly types.

During this task you will explore KVASIR dataset. 

You should train a classification model on the given medical dataset to classify anomalies in Gastrointestinal Tract using endoscopic imagery. 
We recommend  using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network with transfer learning.

The dataset consists of 8,000 annotated GI tract images in 8 different classes (different annomalies) where 1000 images belong to each class.

It contains anatomical landmarks; z-lines, pylorus and cecum, pathological finding; esophagitis, polyps, and ulcerative colitis and polyp removal signs ; dyed-lifted-polyps, dyed-resection-margins.
